# Insurance Claim Filing with AI 

<img style="border-radius: 10px;" src="https://github.com/aymenfurter/copilot-insurance-claim-demo/blob/main/sceenshot.png">
This repository demonstrates a new approach to filing insurance claims, combining traditional methods with an "intelligent app" version. The intelligent app leverages GPT-4 Vision for initial claim analysis, followed by processing requests through the Semantic Kernel's planning capabilities. 

## Features
- **Traditional Claim Filing**: A standard, straightforward method for users to file their insurance claims.
- **Intelligent App**: An advanced feature that uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze claim details and Semantic Kernel for decision-making on policy coverage.

## Prerequisites 
To deploy and run this application, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
* Java 17
* Maven
* Git

## Setup Procedure
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.
4. Run the application and access it via `http://localhost:8080`.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Use Semantic Kernel to do GPT-4 Vision analysis (once supported).
